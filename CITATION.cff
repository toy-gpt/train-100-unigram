  Inspectable language-model training repositories demonstrating
  next-token prediction across controlled corpus regimes.
  This repository implements a unigram next-token prediction model trained with
  softmax and cross-entropy loss on an intentionally neutral corpus.
  It assists with understanding probabilistic language modeling,
  training loops, and inspectable model artifacts
  prior to introducing higher-order context, embeddings, or attention mechanisms.
